            As a software engineering student, I have been involved in various projects in which I worked with database designing, software and web developing as well as testing. This opportunity provided me with an introduction to web application development and strengthened my programming quotient. Through my involvement with software and web development, I have developed the technical problem-solving, design, and teamwork skills required for this position. 
            To further enhance my professional skills and in a quest for learning I have worked I worked as an IT & Web support technician at the Ayendah Sazan Education Centre, a small charity organization in Leeds, England. I was responsible for maintaining and updating several of the organization's web applications, software, and hardware and was involved in developing a web-based control system to monitor and report remote host/services using the REST web service. This opportunity has further expanded my knowledge and skills into technologies and developing large skills systems. During this period, I have practiced different technology and software to enhance my understanding of technology and improve my programming skills.   
            In addition to my experience and personal qualities, I have a solid educational foundation and passion for software and web development and design. Also, my experience as an Interpreter has greatly improved my confidence in dealing with problems solving, working as a team and with a variety of age groups, which I believe will enable me to build a productive working relationship with clients and colleagues at working place, ability to priorities and work on multiple projects at any one time and confident working as part of a team as well as individually.
